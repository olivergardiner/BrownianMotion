# BrownianMotion
Open hardware guitar pedal that uses JFETs for a complete emulation of a valve amp, derived from the Infinite Improbability Drive but with only one gain stage and two tone controls to give an "amp in a box" feel to the distortion but with more rock than metal.

The generated Gerber files are provided as a Release - the repository only contains the design files for DesignSpark PCB v10.

The Visio file provides the template for drilling and printing (e.g. with a waterslide or self-adhesive decal) a 1590BB enclosure.
